##### Abstract

We introduce a new microeconomic model of horizontal differentiation that unifies and extends previous developments inspired by Hotellingâ€™s (1929) seminal work. Our framework incorporates boundedly rational consumers, an unlimited number of firms, and arbitrary differentiation spaces with Riemannian manifolds. We argue that Riemannian geometry provides a natural and powerful tool for analyzing such models, offering fresh insights into firm behavior and market structure with complex products.

*Currently submitting the paper to Econometrica.*
